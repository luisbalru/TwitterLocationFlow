## Welcome to TwitterLocationFlow

In this page you will be able to find the progress in my Virtual Infrastructure project!! Here you have some information:

### About the project

Enjoy the interactions flow between Twitter's users around a topic! Choose whatever word or hashtag you are keen on and discover in a world map where are people who are tweeting about that topic. Besides, if there are conversations between Twitter users about the topic you like, you will see in the map arcs or flows between the users.

### Tools
Python will be the programming language used. Basically, the data structure which lie beneath my app is a graph, so I'm using a graph database to warehouse my information. I have choosen *Neo4j* due to the fact that is Open Source, supports ACID and I will be able to use it buil-in REST web API interface.
